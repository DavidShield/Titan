# Titan
Developed an interactive web application to display events near a user’s location, allow users set favorite events and recommend events by classifying the event category (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
Created two deployment environments: Java servlets with RESTful API to handle HTTP requests and responses; Spring MVC gradle with annotation of ‘RestController’ and ‘Controller to handle both RESTful and normal.
Used MySQL and NoSQL database (MongoDB) to save data and using TicketMaster API to finding events.
Deployed the whole system both on a local machine and AMAZON EC2 which can handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
